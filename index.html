        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>It is my desire to work in a team environment for a company that believes in investing in its employees 
            and community. In my professional life, I have proven myself to be self-motivated, 
            honest, able to manage my time, and love to be challenged and learn new things 
            to keep growing.
